SBE 1.7.6.2 cracked: 
output.jar

crashes if renamed, ah data DOESN'T WORK because it requires SBEAPI

To set your hypixel apikey: go to appdata/.minecraft/config/SkyblockExtras.cfg

then edit where it says api

It is normal to give you tons of errors when logging in


SkyblockAddons 1.6.0 beta 7: 
SkyblockAddons-1.5.4-for-MC-1.8.9.jar

think its a virus and i put session id logger in it?

Check for yourself with: 
jd-gui-1.6.6.jar

If you do not trust this either
